"""Anterior comments from previous analysis

The files with missing informations about the authors (in the true folder) were corrected manually (Pertum - 09/01/2021)
 
The size_normalized_text "586.txt" doesnÂ´t exist... so, by convienecy, this file was removed from the dataset. Primarlly this was made because a music of Gabriel Pensador it's not a fake news ??? end second because the full_text 586.txt" were incomplete. 
Another reason why "586.txt" was removed it's because this file was 
not normilized with the respective true news (Pertum - 09/01/2021)

The fake file "1607.txt" was removed too. He was removed because it wasb incomplete, incomplete in meta information as well in full text content (Pertum - 09/01/2021)
